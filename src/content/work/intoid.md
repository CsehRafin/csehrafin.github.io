I serve as the General Secretary of the International Organization for Identity Documents (IOID/OIDI), where I oversee the organization’s global mission to strengthen trust, interoperability, and governance in electronic identity and travel document systems. As the principal author of the IOID/OIDI Constitutive Charter, I lead both its institutional and technical development, ensuring that our frameworks adhere to international standards and meet the evolving needs of governments, organizations, and citizens worldwide.

Within IOID/OIDI, I direct programs focused on the design, implementation, and governance of secure identity ecosystems, including electronic Machine Readable Travel Documents (eMRTDs), electronic Passports (ePassports), and electronic Identification (eID) systems. I currently lead the development of a new international standard for electronic Machine Readable Identity Documents (eMRIDs) under IOID/OIDI, a comprehensive framework redefining trust, privacy, and interoperability in global identity management.

My work extends to the design of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and document verification architectures that enable the secure issuance, authentication, and validation of identity documents across jurisdictions. I also oversee the formation of IOID/OIDI’s trust and cloud architecture, including multi-cloud and sovereign infrastructure, advanced cryptographic protocols, and biometric authentication systems supporting digital identity verification and interoperability.

In addition to my organizational and technical leadership, I am actively involved in policy harmonization and international cooperation, integrating principles of law, cybersecurity, and digital governance to promote standards-based identity ecosystems that preserve privacy, integrity, and global trust.

I am the principal author of the statutes of the International Public Key Directory Organization (IPKDO) and the International Public Key Directory (IPKD), a global directory designed to provide trust and verification frameworks for all participating states and international entities. I am also the principal author of the statute of the International Committee for Identity Documents (ICID), a advisory and research-focused body under IOID/OIDI’s Charter that supports coordination, standardization, and knowledge exchange in global identity systems.

Parallel to these institutional projects, I am leading the development of D’IDENTITÉ’s IDENTITÉ Wallet and an authentication web application, part of a broader initiative to build secure, user-centric digital identity solutions integrating IOID/OIDI’s emerging standards and frameworks.

Through these initiatives, my work continues to advance IOID/OIDI’s vision to build a secure, interoperable, and inclusive global identity framework, ensuring that digital and physical identity systems evolve in harmony with technological progress and human rights principles.
